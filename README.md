# Progman_Code_Challenge
This piece of code was written for a Finnish company called Progman as part of a job interview. 
It proved that I could write C# and understand object-oriented programming.

Initially the idea was to write a small console application, that prints out the contents of an air handling unit.

The unit contains 2 fans, 2 filters, a coil and a heat exchanger. 

Each part has a product code and a description along with specialized characteristics to print out. The order of the printing
is based on the product code.

There were no specifications on how the internals of the parts were to be represented, so I just made them up on the fly.
